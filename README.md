# Messenger
Self-Developed non-session based simple Messenger

## Requirements:
1> php Server

## How to use:
1> Host index.php over php server as is.

2> Add clear.php in the same directory of index.php. This lets clear chat when accessed.

3> To save messages, create a file named index.htm in the same directory (as that of index.php)

>>> That's it ... :)


## Further Reading:
The messenger does not require JavaScript at all. Thus applicable on older (mobile) browsers as well.
I have implemented kill command to clear all messages. User Input of "#CS" will clear all the messages while adding auto-scroller (javaScript based). You may change this in the code however.
