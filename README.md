# Messenger
Self-Developed non-session based simple Messenger

## Requirements:
1> php Server

## How to use:
1> Host index.php over php server as is.

2> To save messages, create a file named index.htm in the same directory (as that of index.php)

>>> That's it ... :)


## Further Reading:
The messenger does not require JavaScript at all. Thus applicable on older (mobile) browsers as well.
I have implemented kill command to clear all messages. User Input of "#C" will clear all the messages. You may change this in the code however.

## API
Demo for this is hosted at: api.aamer.xyz/messenger
